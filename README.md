# Physics Simulator
Physics Simulator created during A-Levels, built using python and pygame; the program allows you to interact with pendulums and waves 

## Prerequisites
pygame has been installed using:
pip install pygame

## Improvements/Optimisation
Since this code was written a while ago, it can definite be improved - possible tasks include:
1. Ensure code is written under correct style - which it is currently not
2. Seperate the code into multiple files and folders, this is currently very bad practise!
3. Optimise the current code using more standard library functions, reduce LOC - many optimisations to be made
4. Add additional functionality - there are many possibilities here
5. Correct commenting style, currently overcommented and other comments could explain lines better
